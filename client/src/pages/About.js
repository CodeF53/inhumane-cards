        Yes. This was all made by a single person.

      <h2>How was this made?</h2>
      <p>
        The backend for this project is made with a Ruby on Rails backend and the frontend is made in React.js.

        <br/><br/>

        I am planning on moving to Next.js soonâ„¢ because the React.js devs literally say to not use Create-React-App and also it should help with frontend performance.

        <br/><br/>

        The backend being made with Rails is the main reason for all of the remaining bugs, as it was clearly not designed for a live updating card game.
